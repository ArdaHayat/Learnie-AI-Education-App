###  NLP Chatbot (using GPT-like model)
We could be using openai API for the chatbotâ€™s NLP functionality. This simple example shows how to send text to an OpenAI model like GPT and receive responses.

import openai

# Your OpenAI API key (make sure to replace it with your actual key)
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

def chat_with_learnie(user_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Can be adjusted based on the model
        prompt=user_input,
        max_tokens=100,  # Limits the response size
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,  # Controls the randomness of the response
    )

    # Returning the chatbot's response
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
user_input = "What is the capital of France?"
response = chat_with_learnie(user_input)
print(f"Learnie: {response}")
